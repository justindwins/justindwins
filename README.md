Hi, Iâ€™m @justindwins. 42 years old and I speak multiple languages (not Russian, neither Chinese). I'm an IT generalist, a jack of all trades. I hate programming. I have a broad knowledge base and 20 years of experience in IT. Since a few years I've been building up my cybersecurity skills and knowledge. 

Currently I'm an ethical hacker doing recon on my close neighbourhood.

I actually come from the time when the animals could speak and sub7 was a horse. Since February 2022 I finished my final post-graduate studies, cybersecurity professional,  in the book called "my life". I keep studying forever but I'm never going to school again.
I'm actually passionate about cybersecurity, beer, my cats and cycling.

The more I know, the more I don't know.

If you see my name in your logs, I'm covered by Belgian's CCB law. If you don't see my name or you don't have logs, well...

ðŸ“« You know how to reach me. If not, maybe I'm just "not social".
