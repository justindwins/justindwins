Hi, Iâ€™m @justindwins. 42 years old and I speak multiple languages (not Russian, neither Chinese). I'm an IT generalist, a jack of all trades. I hate programming. I have a massive and broad knowledge base and 20 years of experience in IT. 

I actually come from the time when the animals could speak and sub7 was a horse. Since February 2022 I finished my final post-graduate studies, cybersecurity professional,  in the book called "my life". I keep studying forever but I'm never going to school again.
I'm actually interested in cybersecurity, beer and cycling.

Iâ€™m currently learning everything related to cybersecurity. I know I should study more about cloud security. And I still don't like programming.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects.

But first... trying some Android hacking and finding m0râ‚¬ fund$.

ðŸ“« You know how to reach me. If not, maybe I'm just not social.
